# Numbrix Generator ðŸš€
Welcome to the Numbrix Generator project! This tool allows you to generate and solve Numbrix puzzles of various sizes.

## What is Numbrix?
Numbrix is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a grid with consecutive numbers that connect horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. The puzzle provides a partially filled grid, and the challenge is to complete the grid without breaking the consecutive number chain.

## Example
For a 3x3 grid:

```
1 2 3
8   4
7 6 5
```

In the above grid, numbers from 1 to 9 are placed in such a way that they connect consecutively without any diagonal moves.
